# djn_docker_assignment

Although very similar to the class project, this assignment enabled me to go back as far as 6 classes ago to understand the rudiments and basis of this project, and now, I have a grasp of the concept of the project. 
I went from 25% understanding to at least 80%. 
More of this to come.
